\subsection*{Better Security Decision with Situational Awareness}

Nowadays, a lot of ''invisible'' compromised computers are controlled by attackers with the owner being unaware. The data on these computers may be mined and exposed every day, and the computers may be utilized in different kinds of abuse and criminal activities.
The Hong Kong Security Watch Report aims to provide the public a better ''visibility'' of the situation of the compromised computers in Hong Kong so that they can make better decision in protecting their information security.

The data in this report is about the activities of compromised computers in Hong Kong which suffer from, or participate in various forms of cyber attacks, including web defacement, phishing, malware hosting, botnet command and control centres (C\&C) or bots. Computers in Hong Kong are defined as those whose network geolocation is Hong Kong, or the top level domain of their host name is ''.hk''.

\subsection*{Capitalizing on the Power of Global Intelligence}

This report is the fruit of the collaboration of HKCERT and global security researchers. Many security researchers have the capability to detect attacks targeting their own or their customers??networks. Some of them provide the information of IP addresses of attack source or web links of malicious activities to other information security organizations with an aim to collaboratively improve the overall security of the cyberspace. They have good practice in sanitizing personal identifiable data before sharing information.

HKCERT collects and aggregates such valuable data about Hong Kong from multiple information sources for analysis with Information Feed Analysis System (IFAS), a system developed by HKCERT. The information sources (Appendix 1) are very distributed and reliable, providing a balanced reflection of the security status of Hong Kong.

We remove duplicated events reported by multiple sources and use the following metrics for measurement to assure the quality of statistics.

\section*{Highlight of Report}

This report is for QUARTER.

In QUARTER2, there were UNIQUEEVENTS uique security events related to Hong Kong used for analysis in this report. The informatoin is collected with IFAS\footnote{IFAS - Information Feed Analysis System is a HKCERT developed system that collects global security intelligence relating to Hong Kong to provide a picture of the security status.} from 19 sources of information.\footnote{Refer to Appendix 1 for the sources of information} They are not from the incidents reports received by HKCERT.

\caption{Trend of security events{\protect\footnote{The numbers were adjusted to eclude the unconfirmed defacement events}}}
\end{figure}

The total number of security events in QUARTER2 increased dramatically by 99\% or 10 851 events, reached a record high since Q2 2013. The increase was due to server events.

\subsection*{Server related security events}

Server related security events include malware hosting, phishing and defacement. Their trends and distributions are summarized below:

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=10cm]{ServerDisBar}}
\caption{Trend and distribution of server related security events{\protect\footnote{The numbers were adjusted to eclude the unconfirmed defacement events}}}
\end{figure}

The number of server related security events increased dramatically from 5,867 to 16,338 
(increased by 178\%) in Q2 2015. The number of server related security events, phishing events 
and malware hosting events all reached a record high. 
In this quarter, the number of defacement events increased slightly by 5\% but the number of 
phishing  events  and  malware  hosting  events  increased  dramatically  by  168\%  and  412\% 
respectively. 
The increase of phishing events was contributed by a few phishing campaigns. In this quarter, 
the top phishing target was a Japanese gaming site hiroba.dqx.jp. This campaign utilized more 
than 10 IP addresses and 3200 URLs, which equals more than 40\% of all phishing events. The 
second and third phishing targets were both Chinese online merchants, namely taobao.com 
and xzhjia.com, more than 1600 and 1200 URLs were targeting them respectively. As of the 
time of writing, most of these phishing URLs were no longer accessible. 
Among the malware hosting events, about 41\% or 2828 events were hosting 
HTML/Drop.Agent.AB malware. It was found that this malware was related to the Ramnit 
botnet.

\subsection*{Botnet related security events}

Botnet related security events can be classified into two categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Botnet Command and Control Centers (C\&C) security events - involving small number of powerful computers, mostly servers, which give commands to bots
\item Botnet security events - involving large number of computers, mostly home computers which receive commands from C\&Cs.
\end{itemize}

\underline{Botnet Command and Control Servers}

The trend of botnet C\&C security events is summarized below:
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=10cm]{BotnetCCBar}}
\caption{Trend of Botnet (C\&Cs) security events}
\end{figure}
The number of botnet Command and Control Servers remain unchanged this quarter.
There were 4 C\&C servers reported in this quarter. One of the reported servers was identified as Zeus C\&C server, while the other three were identified as IRC bot C\&C servers.

\underline{Botnet Bots}

The trend of botnet (bots) security events is summarized below:
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=10cm]{BotnetBotsBar}}
\caption{Trend of Botnet (Bots) security events}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
Number of Botnet (bots) on Hong Kong network slightly increased in this quarter, stopping 
the dropping trend since Q3 2014. 
In Q2 2015, the number of botnet infections in Hong Kong increased by 8\%. The Virut botnet 
increased significantly by 87\%. It took over Zeus to become the second largest botnet in Hong 
Kong.
Other than Virut, three botnets, namely Ramnit, Tinba and Dyre, entered the top 10 the first 
time. 

\textbf{Ramnit} 

Ramnit is a fully-featured worm. It can steal various types of sensitive information including 
web credentials, FTP credentials, browser cookies and files, etc. It can allow the attackers to 
access  the  victim?™s  file  system  and  take  control  of  the  computer.  It  can  also  download 
additional malwares. 

Ramnit first appeared in 2010 and spreaded quickly. Now it has infected more than 3.2 million 
computers  worldwide.  On  25  Feb,  an  operation  driven  by  law  enforcement\footnote{http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/ramnit-cybercrime-group-hit-major-law-enforcement-operation} ,  led  by  the 
Europol and assisted by industry partners Symantec, Microsoft, and others, seized the servers 
and other infrastructure owned by the cybercrime group behind the Ramnit botnet. A large 
amount of victims were identified that it became the 6th botnet this quarter. 

Ramnit spreads through file infection, exploit kits hosted on websites and social media, public FTP servers and bundle with other software.

\textbf{Tinba} 

Tinba is a banking Trojan that can perform Man in the Browser (MiTB) attack to steal banking 
credentials. Tinba was first identified in 2012. It first targeted the users in Turkey and then 
users in Czech. But now it targets a large scope of banks worldwide\footnote{https://blog.avast.com/2014/09/15/tiny-banker-trojan-targets-customers-of-major-banks-worldwide/}. 

Tinba employed  some  interesting anti-sandboxing  tricks  to evade analysis\footnote{https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002810.html}.  First  it detects 
user interactions by checking the mouse movement and the active window. If Tinba is running 
inside a sandbox, the mouse location and the active window will always be the same, it will 
not execute the main routine until some user interaction is detected. Moreover, it will detect 
the disk capacity. If the disk is too small, it is likely to be a sandbox environment. Tinba will 
just quit in this case. Tinba spreads through exploit kits and spam emails. 

\textbf{Dyre} 

Dyre  is  a  banking  Trojan  that  successfully  stole millions  in  2015\footnote{http://securityintelligence.com/dyre-wolf/ }.  It monitors  the website 
visited by the victims. Once a victim logins to one of the targeted banks websites, Dyre will 
display  a  fake  screen  claiming  the  site  is  experiencing  issues  and  asks  the  victim  to  call  a 
number. In the phone call, the criminals would try to social engineer critical information from 
the victim. With this information, the criminal will transfer money from the victim?™s account 
to offshore accounts. To make things worse, the criminals will immediately launch a DDoS 
against the victim for distraction. 

Like Tinba, Dyre also employed anti-sandboxing trick\footnote{http://www.seculert.com/blog/2015/04/new-dyre-version-evades-sandboxes.html }. But instead of using a few tricks, Dyre 
use only one ??by checking how many processor cores the system has. If the machine has only 
one core, it will terminate. As most sandboxes were configured with only one core and most 
modern  computers  have  multicores,  this  simple  trick  was  proven  to  be  highly  effective. 
Researchers  tested  a Dyre  sample with  eight  sandboxes,  all  of  them  failed  to  analyze  the 
malware. Dyre spreads through spam emails.

HKCERT has been following up the security events received and proactively engaged local 
ISPs for the botnet clean up since June 2013. Currently, botnet cleanup operations against 
major botnet family W Pushdo, Citadel, ZeroAccess and GameOver Zeus are still in action. 

HKCERT urges general users to join the cleanup acts. Ensure your computers are not being 
infected and controlled by malicious software. Protect yourself and keep the cyberspace clean.

\subsection{Botnets - Bots}
\subsubsection{Major Botnet Families{\protect\footnote{Major Botnet Families are selected botnet families with considerable amount of security events reported from the information sources constantl across the reporting period.}}}

Individual botnet's size is calculated from the maximum of the daily counts of unique IP address attempting to connect to the botnet in the report period. In other words, the real botnet size shold be larger becaues not all bots are powered on the same day.
